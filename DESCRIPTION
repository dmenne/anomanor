Description: This app provides online training for physicians and other practitioners 
  using high-resolution anorectal manometry and the London Classification for 
  disorders of anorectal function. It provides the opportunity to compare 
  performance against a reference standard set by the lead authors of this 
  classification system. Data acquired during this training will be used to 
  assess inter-observer agreement between practitioners.
