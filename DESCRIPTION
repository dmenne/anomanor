Description: Online training for physicians and other practitioners
  using high-resolution anorectal manometry and the London Classification for
  Disorders of Anorectal Function. It provides the opportunity to compare
  performance against a reference standard set by the lead authors of this
  classification system. Data acquired during this training will be used to
  assess inter-observer agreement between practitioners.
