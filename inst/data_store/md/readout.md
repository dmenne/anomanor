![](readout_record_combo.png){style="float:right"}You can select records and phases in arbitrary sequence for classification from the dropdown boxes. Classifications can be temporarily *saved* for later modification, or *finalized* for submission.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Select the classification by clicking on the branch of the tree. For definitions, consult the London Classification of the phase.![](readout_london.png)

Cross-sections will be used for the refinement of classification criteria in the next revision of the *London Classification*.

If you did not add a cross-section, on *Save* or *Finalize* you will be nudged to add it to indicate the part of the record that best supports your classification choice.

Optionally, you can add a comment in the lower right corner.

You can infer the status of individual classifications from the icon:

Nothing done yet, , , Partially completed, Saved, Finalized

## Example cases `$ex1..$ex5`

There are 5 example cases at the top of the dropdown, marked `$ex1..$ex5` for which the balloon expulsion success is not given. These cases are just there so that you can practice with the analysis software. As and when you are happy with the controls you can skip any remaining examples, because they do not count toward study completion.

To get the example cases away from the top of the list, just dummy-rate these. Nobody gets fired for rating all examples normals.
