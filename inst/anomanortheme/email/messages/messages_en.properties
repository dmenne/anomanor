executeActionsSubject=The Anal Manometry Website is waiting for you
executeActionsBody=The international working group for disorders of GI motility and function invites you to participate in the <i>IAPWG Anorectal High-Resolution Manometry Inter-Rater Agreement Study<i>.\nEnhanced visualization of anorectal motility and function provided by anorectal high-resolution manometry with pressure topography (AR-HRM) as set out in the London Classification offers a potential diagnostic advantage over conventional line tracings (CLT). However, evidence demonstrating a significant diagnostic advantage of AR-HRM over CLT is limited. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the inter-rater agreement and/or accuracy for diagnosis of anorectal disorders is different between AR-HRM and CLT. This follows the successful model used to demonstrate the superiority of esophageal HRM for diagnosis of upper GI motility disorders.\nIf you wish to take part in this study, then please click on the link below to register your interest. You will be asked to supply a new password for the account, and enter your full name.\n<a href="{0}">Link to account update</a>\nThis link will expire within {4}.
