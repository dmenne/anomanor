## Overview

EUGIM Hub Project: Educational training of physicians working with high-resolution anorectal manometry
![readme_sample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/506275/146637934-4f688341-d62a-47f6-aa63-cb420e62239b.png)

Interactive application providing online training for physicians and other practitioners using high-resolution anorectal manometry and the [London
Classification](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nmo.13679) for disorders of anorectal function. It provides the opportunity to
compare classification performance using High-Resolution-Manometry (HRM) and conventional manometry against a "reference standard" set by the lead authors of this classification system. Data acquired during this training will be used to assess inter-observer agreement between practitioners.

The results will be published. All those completing all 50 cases will be acknowledged. The information obtained will contribute to the development of version 2.0 of the London classification.

The program uses [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)/[R](https://www.r-project.org/) and is under [MIT Licence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).
